                <p>NANCY BARBARA SLAY, 65, of Elizabeth Lake passed peacefully away on December 28, 2013 in the arms of her husband, with her family by her side. Nancy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 21, 1948, to the late Francis “Frank” and Mary Velma (Vidrine) Curran. Nancy graduated from St. Paul High School of Santa Fe Springs, CA, in 1966, and from California State University, Long Beach in 1970. She went on to receive her Master's degree from the University of La Verne.</p>

                <p>Nancy dedicated almost forty years of service to the Palmdale School District, proudly and conscientiously educating thousands of Palmdale school children, primarily kindergarteners at Yucca Elementary, before moving on to an administrative position “teaching teachers” and eventually retiring in 2009. In addition to her duties at the Palmdale School District, Nancy also served as an adjunct instructor for the University of La Verne and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Nancy was a proud member of the Delta Kappa Gamma Society.</p>

                <p>Nancy is survived by her best friend and loving husband of 44 years, Charles; son Matthew and his wife Jennifer of Leona Valley, and son Christopher and his wife Holly of Long Beach. She leaves behind twin grand daughters, LilleeRose and Irelynn, who she perpetually loved and spoiled.</p>

                <p>Nancy is also survived by her large and extraordinarily close group of siblings, Charles Curran and his wife Elizabeth of Sacramento, CA, Anthony Curran and his wife Tane of Shingletown, CA, Madeleine Williams and her partner Thomas of Houston, TX, Mark Curran and his wife Christine of Long Beach, CA, Joseph Curran and his wife Tatum of Berkeley, CA, and Teresa Curran-Godsil and her husband Joseph of Long Beach, CA. She will be sorely missed by her numerous nieces and nephews.</p>

                <p>In addition to her family, she leaves behind countless close friends, including many spanning several decades and many mentees with whom she shared her passion for education.</p>

                <p>A visitation and memorial will be held at Chapel of the Valley (1755 E. Ave. R in Palmdale) on Friday, January 10, from 3 – 7 PM, with eulogies beginning at 5 PM and a Rosary to be prayed at 6 PM. Funeral services will take place on Saturday, January 11 at Father Serra Parish (42121 60th St. West in Lancaster), beginning at 10 AM, with burial immediately following at Good Shepherd Cemetery (43121 70th St. West in Lancaster).</p>

                <p>Nancy lived her life as beautifully, gracefully, and elegantly as any of the innumerable flowers she tended around her home and as pristine as the white blossoms of the family’s cherry orchard. For this reason, the family specifically encourages floral tributes. Her love and friendship were as sweet and reliable as her cherry crop, so individuals attending her services are encouraged to integrate cherries in their attire.</p>
